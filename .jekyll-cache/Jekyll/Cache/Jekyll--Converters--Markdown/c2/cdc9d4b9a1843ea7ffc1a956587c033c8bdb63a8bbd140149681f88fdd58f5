<p>While looking I was inspired by  <a href="https://www.nestpick.com/generation-z-city-index-2019/">an article</a> they published about the best citys to live in for Generation Z. They put together a database that ranked each city in multiple different categories like safety, affordability, etc. They had all of the raw data posted in the article but no good way to organize the information. I sent them an idea about creating a person to country matchmaker that allowed you to scale the importance of each category. They loved the idea and are currently writing up a statement of work for me to complete the project!</p>
