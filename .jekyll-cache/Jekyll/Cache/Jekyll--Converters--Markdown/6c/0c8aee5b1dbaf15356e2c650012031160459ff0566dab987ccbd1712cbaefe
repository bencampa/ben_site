<p>I am a Computer Science major and an Astronomy minor at the University of Michigan in my junior year. GO BLUE!!! I grew up in San Francisco, CA and came to Michigan on a track and field scholarship, but quit right after finishing my first computer science class in the winter of my freshman year. I had found exactly what I wanted to do! Since then my intrigue has only grown as I have become the resident “Computer Guy” for my family and friends. Every time 
I come across a clever open-source program built by someone else, I find myself spending all night messing around with its capabilities. I would love to be apart of a team that would help focus my coding efforts and collaborate with others to create a product that millions can interact with and enjoy.</p>
