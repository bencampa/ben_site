<p>I am a computer science major and a Astronomy minor at the University of Michigan in my junior year. GO BLUE!!! I grew up in San Francisco, CA and came to Michigan on a track and field scholarship, but quit right after finishing my first computer science class in the winter of my freshman year. I had found exactly what I wanted to do! Since then my intrigue has only grown. Everytime 
I come across a clever open source program built by someone else, I find myself spending all night messing around with it.</p>
