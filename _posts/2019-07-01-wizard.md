-Worked with Angular (Web framework) to create a tiered permission and access level comment sections that followed the Redux pattern on a new healthcare-related enterprise website. 

-Used DevExtreme (HTML application framework) to design a custom pop-up comment section that included both user and date imprinting.

-Created extensive Mock Web-API data that helped run and test the website during the development.

-Designed and built a complex multi-tiered database that allows comment viewing by both users and employees. Also created a secure access level structure that only allows designated comments to be created and viewed by agency employees.
